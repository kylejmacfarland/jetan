## About Jetan

Jetan, or Martian chess, is a fictional chess variant created by Edgar Rice Burroughs for his novel The Chessmen of Mars.

### Rules Interpretations

The rules as described in the novel and its appendix can be vague and contradictory.

The rules of Jetan described by Burroughs have been interpreted and, in some cases, modified for the sake of playability and ease of understanding for this program. This implementation could very well be described as a variation of the original game.
